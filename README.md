# falcon-9-predictive-intel
[ MODULE : FALCON_9_PREDICTIVE_INTEL ] - Data science pipeline utilizing multi-model machine learning (SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression) to determine Falcon 9 first-stage landing success and launch cost-optimization parameters.


# [ MODULE : FALCON_9_PREDICTIVE_INTEL ]

### [ MISSION_OVERVIEW ]
Deployment of an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to analyze historical telemetry and predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings. This intelligence allows for precise cost-benefit analysis between reusable ($62M) and expendable ($165M) launch configurations.

### [ ANALYTICAL_STRIKE_FORCE ]
* **Data Preparation:** Standardization and normalization via Scikit-Learn.
* **Logistic Regression:** Tuned for binary classification of landing outcomes.
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Multi-kernel optimization via GridSearchCV.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Spatial clustering validation for recovery zone accuracy.
