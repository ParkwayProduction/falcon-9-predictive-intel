# [ MODULE : FALCON_9_PREDICTIVE_INTEL ]

### [ MISSION_OVERVIEW ]
Deployment of an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to analyze historical telemetry and predict the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings. This intelligence facilitates precise cost-benefit analysis between reusable ($62M) and expendable ($165M) launch configurations.

### [ ANALYTICAL_STRIKE_FORCE ]
* **Data Preparation:** High-precision standardization and normalization of telemetry logs via Scikit-Learn.
* **Logistic Regression:** Fine-tuned for binary classification of mission success.
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Kernel-optimized classification via GridSearchCV.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Spatial clustering validation for recovery zone accuracy.
