Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.   In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline  to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a8bc0980-2128-4542-9937-b5c686af7b3a"},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/landing_1.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3b2d2ffd-9439-446b-844c-c61823e23373"},"source":["Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e13b5b23-5f86-4b83-a8b7-e4e210eafcdb"},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/crash.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8e5b7c7b-9774-441f-82fc-a21a1afc8f48"},"source":["Most unsuccessful landings are planed.
